	abstract = {Currently, the blockchain technology has been widely applied to various industries, and has attracted wide attention. However, because of its unique anonymity, digital currency has become a haven for all kinds of cyber crimes. It has been reported that Ethereum frauds provide huge profits, and pose a serious threat to the financial security of the Ethereum network. To create a desired financial environment, an effective method is urgently needed to automatically detect and identify Ethereum frauds in the governance of the Ethereum system. In view of this, this paper proposes a method for detecting Ethereum frauds by mining Ethereum-based transaction records. Specifically, web crawlers are used to capture labeled fraudulent addresses, and then a transaction network is reconstructed based on the public transaction book. Then, an amount-based network embedding algorithm is proposed to extract node features for identifying fraudulent transactions. At last, the graph convolutional network model is used to classify addresses into legal addresses and fraudulent addresses. The experimental results show that the system for detecting fraudulent transactions can achieve the accuracy of 95\%, which reflects the excellent performance of the system for detecting Ethereum fraudulent transactions.},

	abstract = {With the wide adoption of cryptocurrency, blockchain technologies have become the foundation of such digital currencies. However, this adoption has been accompanied by a surge in cryptocurrency fraud, causing significant losses to financial organizations and individuals. One way to mitigate these losses is to use Federated Learning ({FL}) techniques to detect fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions. This paper provides an overview of secure, privacy-preserving, and scalable Blockchain-based Federated Learning ({BCFL}) as a promising solution for slowing the exponential growth of cryptocurrency fraud. {BCFL} enables multiple entities to collaboratively train machine learning models for detecting fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions without sharing their private data, thus preserving privacy. However, Integrating differential privacy and Secure Multi-party computation ({SMPC}) models in {BCFL} presents an additional scalability challenge. This study provides an overview of {BCFL}, evaluating existing research on its security, privacy, and scalability challenges in detecting cryptocurrency fraud. The review explores existing research and various methodologies, highlighting advancements and challenges in creating effective, privacy-conscious fraud detection solutions for cryptocurrency transactions. We first discuss the current state of {BCFL} in fraud detection, along with its potential advantages and limitations, and then discuss the existing research gaps. In particular, this paper examines various {BCFL} frameworks, consensus algorithms, and block architectures, emphasizing their strengths and limitations in the context of cryptocurrency fraud detection to develop scalable and privacy-preserving solutions. We compare various solutions that address scalability and privacy challenges in {BCFL}, including adopting a geographically distributed cloud computing model that utilizes {SMPC} and lightweight consensus algorithms and protocols to manage computational overheads.},

	abstract = {Over the years with the advent of technology 4.0, there have been an increased inclination towards the blockchain technology and the cryptocurrencies. Thus it is becoming imperative to implement fraud detection techniques over the Ethereum network which nowadays is a popular platform for the developers to create smart contracts and deploy decentralized apps. Over the years the various machine learning algorithms have been growing for the process of fraud detection and in particular neural networks have shown promising results. As such in this paper, a neural-network based approach has been presented for Ethereum fraud detection and to validate the effects of the performance this proposed model has been compared with its peers. In contrast to the various models such as Logistic Regression, {SVM}, Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbour, the neural network perform the best providing an accuracy of about 97.09\% which is higher than the rest. It is then seen that neural networks are relatively effective in learning complex patterns of the dataset and thus classifying the resultant transaction as genuine or fraudulent. Thus this work contribute in the development of effective solutions for fraud detection in the Ethereum and other blockchain platforms, enhancing their security and reliability.},

	abstract = {Ethereum is a software platform that uses the concept of blockchain and decentralizes data by distributing copies of smart contracts to thousands of individuals worldwide. Ethereum, as a currency, is utilized to exchange value worldwide in the absence of a third party to monitor or intervene. However, as online commerce grows, a slew of fraudulent activities, such as money laundering, bribery, and phishing, emerge as the primary threat to trade security. This paper proposes Light Gradient Boosting Machine ({LGBM}) approach for accurately detecting fraudulent transactions. It also examines different models such as Random Forest ({RF}), Multi-Layer Perceptron ({MLP}), etc., based on machine learning and soft computing algorithm for classifying Ethereum fraud detection dataset with limited attributes and compares their metrics with the {LGBM} approach. A comparative study of scores of bagging models is presented to know the applicability of the proposed approach. The light gradient boosting machine ({LGBM}) algorithms and Extreme Gradient Boosting ({XGBoost}) demonstrate the highest accuracies, while {LGBM} shows slightly better performance with 98.60\% for the stated dataset scenarios. Further optimizing the {LGBM} with hyper-parameter tuning, an accuracy of 99.03\% is achieved.},

Cryptocurrency may be the currency of the future, but it is also the heaven for con artists to scam investors from their money. Crypto transactions are irreversible. If the underlying blockchain technology has privacy or mixer capabilities it can be virtually untraceable, which creates a new avenue for criminals to scam victims with ease. Social media impersonation is one of the top scams currently performed by criminals. This study presents an example of a social media impersonation scam and the characteristics of the scam. The qualitative data is gathered from communication between the scammer and the potential victim. This study also indicates that cryptocurrency awareness should be included in cyber security training curriculums.},

	abstract = {Crypto crimes peaked in 2021, and recent years have shown that blockchain is not going to die but will stay with us. In addition, blockchain transaction throughputs are expected to rise, which will make the manual investigation of crimes next to impossible in the future. We need effective and automated solutions to monitor and detect fraudulent activities happening on blockchains. In this paper, we propose a system to detect the blacklisted addresses in the Ethereum blockchain. First, we collected Ethereum blockchain transaction data and blacklisted addresses. Then, we constructed the transaction graph of Ethereum and extracted features of addresses, including some global features like pagerank. Finally, we trained the models of standard machine learning algorithms and predicted the class of the addresses. Our results show that with more than 97\% accuracy we can predict blacklisted addresses.},
